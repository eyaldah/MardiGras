                    <p>The French Quarter of New Orleans City, the largest in the state of Louisiana in the south of the
                        United States,
                        becomes a two-week focal point for parties and unrestrained celebrations. In French Tuesday, the
                        Mardi Gras the
                        famous carnival, Mardi Gras (in many places in the world, comes in New Orleans to the heights of
                        beauty and joy
                        that is nowhere else to be looked like.
                        The French exiles, 1857 the wonderful carnival of New Orleans, which began its first time in the
                        year, is a
                        global attraction for thousands of locals and tourists who plan to arrive in the city for many
                        months in
                        advance. Due to the great demand available during the festival days for accommodation, it is
                        advisable to
                        prepare in advance.
                        40 Carnaval events arrive at their peak on the "Tuesday of the Oil" day, (the beginning of
                        fasting
                        eating meat
                        for a day until Easter) where two colourful carnival parades take place on St. Charles Street.
                        Visiting the city during Carnaval guarantees a unique cultural experience. </p>

                    <h3>Present</h3>
                    <P>
                        New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts of many
                        of
                        the parades on
                        or
                        around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades.
                        Zulu
                        is a mostly
                        African-American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting
                        in
                        late January.
                        At
                        these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and
                        21,
                        not married
                        and in
                        high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and
                        their
                        court of
                        maids
                        (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the
                        ball and
                        parade,
                        such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room.
                        In response to their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Cr√©ole and black New Orleanians, led by a
                        mutual
                        aid group
                        known as
                        "The Tramps", adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and named him
                        King
                        Zulu.[5][18]
                        This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated pageantry, but in time, Zulu became a
                        grand
                        parade in
                        its
                        own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige, the krewe named New
                        Orleans'
                        native son
                        Louis
                        Armstrong as its king.[4]
                        Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls
                        must
                        have dress
                        fittings as early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time
                        between each
                        parade. These balls are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in
                        the
                        city, large
                        and
                        small, depending on the size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th
                        century, the French
                        Opera House was a leading venue for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane
                        Katrina the
                        Municipal Auditorim was the city's most famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years,
                        most
                        are at the
                        ballrooms of various hotels throughout the city. The largest "Super Krewes" use larger venues;
                        Bacchus the
                        Morial Convention Center and Endymion the Superdome.</p>

                        Youth and
                        Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city.

                        founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime.[29]
                        Starting with a
                        push to
                        rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her
                        #fairshare initiative
                        to
                        improve city infrastructure, public transportation, and public parks and green spaces.[30] As
                        part
                        of that
                        initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
                        manufactures
                        and
